A number 'n' is represented by n 1-s.
Sample :
  5 is represented as  1 1 1 1 1
  3 is represented as  1 1 1


Input  : numbers n1 and n2 without delimeters; the machine head points at last 1-symbol of n1.
Output : the greatest common of n1 and n2


Sample (n1 = 4, n2 = 6) :
Input  : 1 1 1 [1] 1 1 1 1 1 1
Output : 1 1
