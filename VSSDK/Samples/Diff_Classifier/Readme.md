**Project Files**

**AssemblyInfo.cs**

This file contains assembly custom attributes.

**DiffClassificationDefinitions.cs**

This file contains the definitions for the various classifications, as well as
the coloring to apply to each classification type.

**DiffClassifier.cs**

This file defines the class that searches a given span of text to locate and
evaluate identifiers.

**DiffClassifierProvider.cs**
