[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/7gjewm7eiwoa2ees?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/AlexEyler/vssdk-extensibility-samples)

These samples demonstrate how to customize the appearance and behavior of the 
Visual Studio IDE and editor. 
The following are some of the ways in which you can extend Visual Studio: 

* Add commands, buttons, menus, and other UI elements to the IDE
* Add tool windows for new functionality
* Add support in Visual Studio for new programming languages
* Add refactoring or language analyzers to fix and improve code
* Add a custom project type or new project or item templates
* Enable high-DPI/high resolutuion, theme-aware, and high contrast images and icons in your UI
  * For Visual Studio 2013, only high-DPI images/icons are supported; use the below sample High-DPI_Images_Icons
  * For Visual Studio 2015, samples that demonstrate using the Image Service/Catalog (for high-DPI, theme-aware, 
    and high contrast support) are denoted below with * and docs can be found [here] (http://aka.ms/VSImageService)

If you've never written a Visual Studio extension before, you can find out how to get started at [VisualStudio.com/integrate](http://aka.ms/pyigr3).
